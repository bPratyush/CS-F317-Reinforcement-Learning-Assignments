# CS-F317-Reinforcement-Learning-Project
Coursework Project for CS F317 Reinforcement Learning

We focused on developing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent capable of operating within a
dynamic and complex grid-based environment. The agentâ€™s objective is to clean the room
which will lead to the maximisation of the cumulative rewards while navigating through a grid,
interacting with various static and dynamic elements, recharging stations, time tunnelling and
stochastic transitions, all while the agent operates under constraints like limited battery life.
